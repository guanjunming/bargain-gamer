## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

1. Create an account at [RAWG](https://rawg.io/apidocs) to get the API Key.
2. Sign up at [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) and create a new Base.
3. Create a table named `Users` with the following fields:

   ```
   - Username (Single line text)
   - Password (Single line text)
   ```

4. Create a table named `Favorites` with the following fields:

   ```
   - UserId (Single line text)
   - GameId (Single line text)
   ```

5. Create an access token at [/create/tokens](https://airtable.com/create/tokens) and add the following scopes:
   ```
   data.records:read
   data.records:write
   ```
   Give the token access to the base you just created in the previous steps.
6. Go to Airtable [API Reference](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/introduction) and select the base to get the ID of the base.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

```bash
VITE_RAWG_API_KEY=         # API key for RAWG API
VITE_AIRTABLE_API_TOKEN=   # Personal access token for access to Airtable API
VITE_AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=     # ID of Airtable base that contains the User and Favorites table
```

### To Run Locally

1. Open terminal and clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/guanjunming/game-haven.git
   ```

2. Navigate to project directory:

   ```bash
   cd game-haven
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

4. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory based on the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section.

5. Run the development server:
